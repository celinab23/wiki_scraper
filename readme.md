# Wikipedia Web Scraper

## Description
Welcome to my first web scraping project.
The Wikipedia scraper consist in retrieving information from one site about the leaders of different countries.
This informatin is later used to extract some information from Wikipedia about each coutry (ex)president.


## Timeline
###  Done:
 - get_first paragraph function.
 - get_leaders() function that integrates a call to get_first paragraph.

### To do:
- Modify the get_leaders() function to refresh the cookie.
- Update this readme file with "Instalation" and "usage.

## Personal situation
