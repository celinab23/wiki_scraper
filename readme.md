# Wikipedia Web Scraper

## Description
Welcome to my first web scraping project.
The Wikipedia scraper consist in retrieving information from one site about the leaders of different countries.
This informatin is later used to extract some information from Wikipedia about each coutry (ex)president.


## Timeline
###  Done:
 - Extraction of information about countries and its leaders
 - Extraction of general information on each country leader
 - Creation of a single function that gets the necessary data from one website and uses it to get data from a second site.

### To do:
- Use the same session to call all the wikipedia pages
- Save the ``leaders_per_country`` dictionary in the `leaders.json` file using the json module
- Combine it all in a .py file instead of a jupyter notebook.
- Update this readme file with "Instalation" and "usage.

## Personal situation
Lost too much time in setting up the environment.
It costed a significant amount of time in the beginning.
Then, once it was time to use beautifulsoup, even more precious lime was lost in trying to remember how to update the virtual evn.

Although it was to follow the project instructions, it would have been better to use an existing venv that had the necessary libraries. 
That saved time could have well served to complete the project.
